This Simple ATM System is a console-based program developed in C, designed to simulate the basic functionality of an ATM machine. The system allows users to interact with a virtual bank account by performing essential operations such as checking their balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and securely exiting the application.

Features:
PIN Authentication: The system begins by asking for a personal identification number (PIN) to ensure secure access to the account. If the user enters the correct PIN, they are granted access to the menu. If the PIN is incorrect, access is denied.

Menu-Driven Interface: Once authenticated, users are presented with a menu of options to choose from:

Check Balance: Displays the current account balance.
Withdraw Money: Allows the user to withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient funds.
Deposit Money: Enables the user to deposit money into their account.
Exit: Exits the ATM system and terminates the program.
Basic Account Operations:

The system supports simple account management with an initial balance (defaulted to $1000.00).
The user can withdraw or deposit funds as needed.
Error handling is incorporated to ensure that withdrawal amounts do not exceed the available balance.
Security: The program uses a fixed PIN (set to 1234 by default). For a more advanced version, the PIN can be modified or stored securely.

Continuous Operation: The program allows users to perform multiple transactions in one session. The menu will keep reappearing until the user opts to exit.

Sample Output:
The ATM will prompt the user for their PIN, display the menu of options, and show relevant results depending on the userâ€™s actions, such as balance information after checking, or updated balance after withdrawing or depositing money.
